MongoDB vs PostgreSQL

Working with MongoDB was a little different. I wasn't as familiar with it as i was with SQL, so it took a little getting used to. I can see the value in it, and the sheer scope of data it can hold. One just has to be organized and more methodical when running queries to ensure ACID-icity.
